# Here is a little bit on my academic and professional journey transitioning into Machine Learning

Back in early 2020, when the world was hit by the COVID-19 lockdown, I stumbled upon some mind-blowing stuff I hadn't heard of before! Tesla, self-driving cars, end-to-end learning, convolution neural networks â€“ all these suddenly entered my radar.

Like any average person, I hit the interwebs to dig deeper into the world of autonomous driving, and it totally piqued my interest. At that time, I was a grad school newbie, just two courses in, and I was all set on pursuing a specialization in Computing Systems at Georgia Tech. But guess what? The whole idea of autonomous driving had me totally hooked, and I decided to switch gears and dive into Machine Learning, even though I had zero prior knowledge about it.

Honestly, it was a bit daunting. I hadn't even taken that famous Machine Learning course by Andrew Ng that everyone seemed to be raving about while most of my peers had a HUGE head-start in the field! While sticking with the familiar Computing Systems specialization would have been way easier due to my past work experience and my undergrad in Computer Science Engineering, I chose to step out of my comfort zone. Yes, I had to give up all those familiarity perks, but you know what? It was totally worth it!

Sure, I was a bit nervous at first, but I loved every single moment of learning something completely alien to me. And guess what? I still do! Every day, I'm diving into new knowledge, reading more than ever, and started seeing patterns I have never noticed before. They spark ideas and I can't help but ask myself, "What if?" and "Why not?" questions. It's a wild ride, but I'm loving every bit of it!
