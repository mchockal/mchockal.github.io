# Who am I?

Hello! My name is Meena. I am a software development engineer with 6 years of experience in classic backend development at different companies and approximately 1 year of work experience as a Machine Learning Engineer at Intel. 

During my internship at Intel, I discovered my strengths in real-life Machine Learning lie in understanding and addressing the challenges involved in building and deploying in-house models both on-premises and on the cloud. My recent interests revolve around fast information retrieval, encompassing both images and text, given a large corpus of data. Currently, I am diving into the world of vector databases, aiming to enhance my knowledge in this area. I also have a keen understanding of the hardware-software interplay that affects the latency and throughput of a model.

I am a strong advocate of engineering best practices and consistently strive to promote their adoption at every possible opportunity. I complement this advocacy with working prototypes that demonstrate the feasibility of these practices. I measure their effectiveness by calculating the percentage of time saved and evaluating other qualitative aspects, such as simplifying developer tasks and creating dashboards with informative reports for swift analysis. 

I consider myself to be curious and a voracious reader, always eager to learn. My collaborative, credible, responsible, and humble nature contributes to my work ethic. I am committed to earning these attributes and do not list them easy on a public facing website unless I have exemplified them in practice.

# What am I looking for in my next role?

In my upcoming role, I envision the chance to operate at the intersection of any two of my primary interests: Infrastructure for large models, Machine Learning, Computer Vision, and Sustainability. Such an opportunity would genuinely align with and fulfill my professional aspirations.

# What do I currently do?

So, May'23 marked my graduation, but things didn't quite go as planned. Unfortunately, due to some budget cuts in the Business Unit, I didn't receive a return offer like all the other interns (bummer, right? â˜¹). But hey, no worriesâ€”I'm using this time to actively search for the next big opportunity where I can achieve amazing things alongside fantastic people, all while soaking up knowledge and growing in the process.

On the bright side, being unemployed gives me the chance to slow down a bit. I can finally revisit those awesome computer vision projects that I had to put on hold. Plus, I'm setting up my GitHub portfolio (including this page you are reading! :D ) to show off my skills and creativity to the world!

Not only that, but Iâ€™m also taking this moment to take care of myself too. Physical and mental health are top priorities, so I'm making sure to give myself the TLC I need. Oh, and let's not forget about my adorable petsâ€”Thor and Lokiâ€”spending quality time with them brings me so much joy! The best part of it all is that I get to travel with my super-supportive and beloved significant other, Poochie <3. Life may not be going exactly as planned, but I'm making the most of it, and I can't wait to see what exciting adventures lie ahead! ðŸŒŸ
